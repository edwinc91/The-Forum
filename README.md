In the beginning, I tried to get all the functionality done before working on the css. I had trouble with the comment, as it kept reading a comment such as "hi" and rendering it on the page like "{0:h, 1:i}". In my 1-on-1 with Matt H, he helped me out a lot with this issue and it was finally fixed. My next problem was using sessions. Initially, I didn't have any user log in, so when I attempted to implement sessions in, my entire code broke, mostly due to having two routes I realized leading to the same path, as well as a missing s on a variable or something of that nature. Another problem I had with session was that I could sign in with incorrect credentials. I fixed it later on eventually after breaking my code at least two more times. I then had some trouble with the upvoting/downvoting. I spent a decent amount of time thinking about it, and finally got something to work.
I tried to add some css elements, but I had to learn Bootstrap first, which took a decent amount of time. I wanted to add my own styling, but at that point, I was running out of time/energy. So, my site looks rather bland/very very bootstrap-y.
